# ML Mini Projects â€“ Learning Portfolio by Diya M

This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning projects I worked on as part of a selection process for a college technical club. While I am no longer part of the selection process, Iâ€™ve retained these projects here to document my learning and growth in core ML concepts.

##  What This Repo Covers

These tasks focus on foundational machine learning workflows using structured data. I explored various algorithms and techniques, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**

Each project includes:
- ðŸ“„ The dataset used (in `.csv` format)
- ðŸ““ A Jupyter Notebook with code and visualisations

## Folder Structure

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Goals & Learning Outcomes

This repo marks my hands-on experience with machine learning. Through these mini-projects, I learned how to:
- Handle real-world CSV data
- Clean and preprocess datasets
- Build and evaluate ML models
- Visualise data insights and model performance
